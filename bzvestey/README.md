# Bryan's Advent of Code 2022 answers

This is the collection of answers Bryan made for Advent of Code 2022.

There are two main ways to run this from withing the directory for a specific day:

1. `go test` in a days directory if there is a `main_test.go` file.
2. Otherwise use `go run main.go` and make sure there is a file names `input` next to `main.go`.

**Special Case**:

Day 16 part 2 with actual input has to be run through `go run cmd/main.go` as the problem will time out using go test.

Have fun and merry coding!
